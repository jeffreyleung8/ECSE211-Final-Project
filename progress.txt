TO-DO:

-Implement methods in Navigation
-Implement methods in RingSearcher
-Implement and link odometerCorrection to other classes


Progress

Oct 30: (Jeffrey)
-added controller package that contains 4 controllers
(one for each sensor: gyro,light,color,us)
-named Lab5.java to Main.java
-added RingSearcher.java in navigation package (will serve to search ring and grab it)
-added Tester.java to test sensors
-moved lightLocalizer and USLocalizer to navigation package

Oct 31: (Lea)
-added complete java doc 

Nov 5: (Jeffrey)
-rearranged code
-added methods to RingSearcher class
-added methods to Navigation class
-added sequence of method calls in Main class

Nov 8: (Jeffrey)
-added robotController(everything related to the motors)
-integrated robotController to code
-added Wifi class
-added enum Team, SearchState

Nov 9: (Lea)
-implemented code for ringSeacher class
-tested ringSearcher
-wifi class not working

Nov 11 : (Jeffrey)
-modified navigation and wifi class to support beta demo
-implemented method to adjust turn with gyroscope
-minor code changes

Nov 13 : (Jeffrey)
-US localization and light localization should be working(tested in the lab)
-code changes in lightLocalizer, USLocalizer, navigation
-succeed to get game parameters to robot from server using wifi class
(in betaDemosetup folder)

Nov 18 : (Jeffrey)
*Replaced one gyroscope by a light sensor put at the back)
-removed gyroSensorController
-added new usLocalization and lightLocalization (working)
-implemented odometryCorrection (working but needs improvements)
-added wifi class for competition
-rearranged code

Nov 20: (Jeffrey)
-moved the two light sensors to the front
-modified odometry correction to support the hardware change
-navigation to tunnel works for starting corner 1,3
-navigation through tunnel works
-navigation to ringset works
-uslocalization doesnt always work

Nov 21: (Lea)
-Added new cases for navigation
-Finished all test cases for when the tunnel is in vertical position
-Finished all test cases for when the tunnel is in horizontal position
-Navigation through tunnel in vertical position works
-Navigation through tunnel in horizontal position needs to be tested

Nov 21: (Jeffrey)
-Finished implementation of navigation class but needs to be tested
-Methods(travelThroughTunnel(), travelToStartingPoint, travelToRingSet(), turnToTunnel())
-Added two methods in wifi class(getClosestCornerToTunnel(), getClosestCornerToSC())

Nov 26 : (Jeffrey)
-Tested new uslocalization (works)
-Localization happens under 30 seconds
-Navigation works (can navigate to the ring set and can navigate back to starting corner)
-Ring detection needs improvement(sometimes detect yellow while the ring is orange, vice versa)
-The two frames are now lifted by the two side motors
-The robot can unload rings (tested)
-Software bug(robot sometimes does unexpected quick turns)
